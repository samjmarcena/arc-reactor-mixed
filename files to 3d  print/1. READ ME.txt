This is all the 3d pieces that i used to do the reactor. The stand is specially my own design, the rest of the pieces i took from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2069812
I started this project in 2019, the pandemic really got in the way so because of that i dont have much pics from the first time i printed the pieces and i also dont remember the config i used in the 3d printer.
